# Audit Pack YAML User Manual (v1.3)

> Canonical architecture term in this repository: **FCDRAG (Fail-Closed Deterministic Corrective RAG)**.


This manual has been split into two focused documents:

1. Strict schema reference:
`XREF_WORKFLOW_II_new/tools/rag_packs/AUDIT_PACK_YAML_STRICT_SCHEMA_REFERENCE_v1_0.md`

2. Examples cookbook:
`XREF_WORKFLOW_II_new/tools/rag_packs/AUDIT_PACK_YAML_EXAMPLES_COOKBOOK_v1_0.md`

Use the schema reference when validating correctness.
Use the cookbook when authoring or tuning packs quickly.
